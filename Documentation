1. What Each HTML Element Does:-
   
<html>: The outermost tag that contains everything in my webpage.
<head>: This part holds the title and meta info that’s not shown on the page.
<title>: Sets the name that appears on the browser tab.
<body>: Holds all the content that appears on the website.
<header>: Used at the top of the page to contain the main title and navigation.
<nav>: Contains the links that take the user to other pages of the website.
<main>: The main content area of my page.
<section>: Helps me divide content into meaningful parts.
<form>: Used to create the contact form.
<label>: Gives a name or title to each form field.
<input>: For taking user input like name, email, phone, etc.
<textarea>: A large text box for messages.
<select>: Dropdown menu for selecting one option.
<option>: Each choice inside the dropdown.
<img>: To show images with a backup description.
<ul> and <ol>: For listing items — unordered and ordered.
<table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>: Used to show my project experience in table format.
<h1> to <h6>: These are headings used to organize content and show importance.
<footer>: Placed at the bottom to show copyright.


2. Why I Chose Specific Input Types:-
   
Text: Best for names or any simple short input.
Email: Validates if the user has typed a proper email address.
Tel: Used for phone numbers; shows a number pad on mobile.
Date: Easy for users to select a date using a calendar.
Range: I used this like a rating slider, e.g., 1 to 10.
Checkbox: Lets the user select more than one contact method.
Radio: Good for choosing one option only.
Required: Helps make sure the form isn't submitted empty


3. How My Navigation Structure Works:-
   
To make my website easy to use, I created a simple and consistent navigation menu on all three pages using the <nav> element.
Each navigation bar contains links (<a>) to the three main pages of my portfolio:

Home → portfolio.html
About Me → about.html
Contact → contact.html

These links are placed inside the <header> of each page so that visitors can access them easily from the top, no matter which page they are on. This helps create a smooth experience 
when someone moves between the pages. By using a consistent layout on every page, I made sure the navigation is user-friendly and predictable, which is important for a portfolio site.
